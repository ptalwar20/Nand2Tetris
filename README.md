# Nand2Tetris

The Repository is an implementation of Nand2Tetris. The objective of the course is to build a Hack Hardware Platform, a simple computer.

Week 1 - Built Elementary gates using Hardware Descriptor Language (specific to Nand2Tetris). The implementation of fundamental Nand gate is provided.

Week 2 - Built Computational Gate or (Combinational Gates) Full-adder, half-adder, Incrementer and Arithmatic Logic Unit.

Week 3 - Build Sequential Gates, Counter, Register, RAM, ROM The implementation of D-Flip Flop is given.

Week 4 - Writing some low level programs using the hack machine language.  Given the hack computer & machine language.

Week 5 - Built the Hack computer platform.

Week 6 - To convert Assembly Language to hardware understandable sequence of bits (1 or 0)
